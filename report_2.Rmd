## Ventilation and Coronavirus (COVID-19)


**An important approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants or contaminants including any viruses that may be in the air is to increase ventilation – the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Ensuring proper ventilation with outside air can help reduce the concentration of airborne contaminants, including viruses, indoors. **

**The ventilation rate should be based on the number of people that occupy an indoor space (and a few other factors), people should give special consideration to increased ventilation when occupancy increases and for areas with high-traffic.**

**Improving ventilation also benefits indoor air quality by reducing exposure to products used for cleaning and disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces.**

**When used along with other best practices recommended by CDC and others, increasing ventilation can be part of a plan to protect people indoors.**



* Elderly Care Facilities, Day Care Centers

* Hotel Rooms

* College Dormitories, School Classrooms

* Multifamily Housing

* Doctor Office, Dentist Clinic

* Hospital Rooms

## *What is ASHRAE?*

[ASHRAE](https://www.ashrae.org/) stands for the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, which is the technical body that develops and maintains ventilation standards for the United States. Ventilation codes and energy efficiency programs throughout the U.S. are based on ASHRAE standards.

Since most of our discussion would be based on the ASHRAE standards, here is a brief overview for two of the most popular subsegment principle in ASHRAE.

<br>

### What is ASHRAE Standard 62.2?

Formed in 1996, the ASHRAE 62.2 committee developed and maintains a residential ventilation standard for buildings three stories and less which is titled Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality in Low-Rise Residential Buildings. It is reviewed and revised every three years. The first version of Standard 62.2 was published in 2003, the second in 2007, and the most current version is ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2010. (ANSI stands for the American National Standards Institute. ANSI certification of a standard means that a specific consensus process was used to develop and maintain the standard and is required for adoption of a standard into codes.) 

ASHRAE Standard 62.2 is the ventilation standard that applies to low-rise residential buildings of three stories or less in the U.S. ASHRAE Standard 62.1 applies to all other buildings.

<br>


### What is ASHRAE Standard 170?

Developed in partnership with Facility Guidelines Institute (FGI) and American Society of Health Care Engineering (ASHE), ASHRAE Standard-170 has been providing key guidance on ventilation requirements for health care industry facilities since 2008. Use Standard 170-2017 alongside HVAC Design Manual for Hospitals and Clinics for comprehensive design guidance on hospitals, nursing and outpatient facilities. 


<br>

### When ASHRAE Standard is Not Enough
Is ASHRAE Standard 62.2/170 current best practice for ventilation? 

In a word, no. The standard that national experts could agree upon that sets a minimum standard for ventilation — not best practice, which would further customize ventilation rates based on factors such as number of occupants in a dwelling and strength of pollutant sources.

Meeting the ventilation requirements for ASHRAE Standard 62.2 will not always provide enough ventilation for a home. In these circumstances, ventilation rates need to be increased beyond the Standard.

* The Standard does not address high-polluting events such as painting, cleaning, smoking or construction projects.
* The Standard does not address the use of unvented combustion space heaters such as unvented decorative gas appliances and kerosene heaters, which are not allowed in California.
* The Standard assumes one person per bedroom, with two people in the master bedroom. Higher numbers of occupants will increase ventilation needs.
* Occupants with health issues such as asthma and allergies may benefit from increased ventilation and/or filtration.

*Note: NR = no requirement*


<br>

### Elderly Care Facilities

[The nursing home](https://app.leg.wa.gov/wac/default.aspx?cite=388-97-4040&pdf=true) must ensure following:

* Ventilation of all rooms is designed to prevent objectionable odors, condensation, and direct drafts on the residents;

* All habitable space is mechanically ventilated including:

  * Air supply and air exhaust systems;
  * Installation of air-handling duct systems according to the requirements of the International Mechanical Code and chapter 51-52 WAC;
  * Installation of supply registers and return air grilles at least three inches above the floor;
  * Installation of exhaust grilles on or near the ceiling
  * Outdoor air intakes located a minimum of twenty-five feet from the exhaust from any ventilating system

The nursing home must locate the bottom of outdoor air intakes serving central systems a minimum of three feet above adjoining grade level or, if installed through the roof, three feet above the highest adjoining roof level.

<br>

### Day Care Centers

<br>

According to [U.S. General Services Administration](https://www.wbdg.org/FFC/GSA/chilcare.pdf), the day care center's ventilation design should follow following instructions:

Design ventilation systems to allow zero exposure of non-smokers to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) even if smoking is limited to outdoor areas, as described in LEED Version 2.0. Design ventilation systems to achieve an air-change effectiveness of minimum 0.9 per ASHRAE 129- 1997 and as described in LEED Version 2.0. Locate air return over diaper and toilet areas

```



### Hotel Rooms

For hotel/motel guestrooms and high-rise residential spaces. The sum of the operable open areas must total at least 5 percent of the floor area of each space that is naturally ventilated. The openings must also be readily accessible to the occupants of the space at all times.

Airflow through the openings must come directly from the outdoors; air may not flow through any intermediate spaces such as other occupied spaces, unconditioned spaces, corridors, or atriums. High windows or operable skylights need to have a control mechanism accessible from the floor.

<br>



### College Dormitories

One thing that College dorms differ from hotel would be schools during summer vacations that are intermittently occupied during summer months. It is important to consider hot or humid climates and mechanically cooled the college dormitories and military barracks that are unoccupied for long periods.

[![](./images/dorm-p.png){width=70%}](https://www.ashrae.org/File%20Library/Technical%20Resources/Standards%20and%20Guidelines/Standards%20Addenda/62.1-2016/62_1_2016_s_20190726.pdf)

<br>

### School Classrooms


<br>


### Multifamily Housing

Research has shown that [multifamily units](https://homes.lbl.gov/ventilate-right/upgrading-multifamily-buildings) have less infiltration of outside air but mostly the air leakage through common walls and ceilings brings in air from the neighbors. Thus to provide adequate whole-building ventilation, multifamily units often need higher levels of mechanical ventilation to compensate for less infiltration.

Section 8 in Addendum j to ASHRAE 62.2-2010 covers multifamily units, which includes higher required airflows for whole-building ventilation, plus airsealing requirements between units in multifamily buildings.

<br>


### Doctor Office


<br>

### Dentist Clinic


Ventilation in the dental office can include placing a high-speed extraoral evacuation system close to the source of contaminants (patient’s mouth) and additionally increasing air flows in mechanical ventilation systems (e.g. hoods, HVAC systems).

Air conditioning of a building or a room controls the purity, humidity and temperature of the indoor air, and it is essential in those buildings with clean zones and clean rooms.
