<p><strong>In this project, we are going to explore some potential markets in United States and intend to discover some critical opportunities for Panasonic ventilation production </strong></p>

<div id="motivation" class="section level2">
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p><br></p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/ventilation-and-coronavirus-covid-19">EPA</a>, an important approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants or contaminants including any viruses that may be in the air is to increase ventilation – the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Ensuring proper ventilation with outside air can help reduce the concentration of airborne contaminants, including viruses, indoors.</p>
<p>The ventilation rate should be based on the number of people that occupy an indoor space (and a few other factors), people should give special consideration to increased ventilation when occupancy increases and for areas with high-traffic. Improving ventilation also benefits indoor air quality by reducing exposure to products used for cleaning and disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces.</p>
<p>When used along with other best practices recommended by CDC and others, increasing ventilation can be part of a plan to protect people indoors.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>#Under the scenario of the global pandemic, the importance of indoor air quality rises as more people concerning for the spread of disease in working and public environment.

##![](./images/interaction.PNG &quot;daily routine&quot;){width=95%}
#Therefore, it is urgent to explore the potential model that Panasonic IAQ division could supply to public institution with some improvements in the quality of air. </code></pre>

<ul>
<li><p>Control of airflow essential, for instance, A 2400 cubic feet room should receiving approximately 80 cubic feet per minute (cfm) of outdoor air.</p></li>
<li><p>Install supplemental exhaust ventilation through dedicated exhaust portals, for example, a 250-cfm booster fan would increase the air exchange rate by approximately 6.5 ACH.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase efficiency of filtration, All rooms are typically equipped with MERV (minimum efficiency reporting value) 7 prefilters and MERV 14 final filters, which remove up to 98% of airborne particles as small as 0.3 to 1.0 mm in diameter (typical diameter of respiratory droplets)</p></li>

<p>In year 2020, there are 643,538 existing Day Care centers in US with a total of 1,519,664 industry employment. Through year 2015-2020 the industry has a stable growth of 2.4% in revenue annually.</p>
<p>Although some day care centers are required to stay open,these facilities are expected to experience increased purchase costs as they must increase spending on sanitizing facilities(Toys) and personal protective equipment for employees, thus leading to an expected 8.1% decline in 2020 alone.</p>

<h5>2. Building special-designed ventalation for children</h5>
<p>This <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17661928/">indoor air quality study</a> actually suggested day care center for kids would need some more sophistically designed ventilation system.</p>
<p>The study demonstrate that the higher prevalence rates of allergic and respiratory symptoms among young children, whose immune system is still under-developed, suggest that ventilation and plausible growth and propagation mechanisms of allergens and infectious agents be further investigated.</p>
<p>In Oregon, such implementation has already taken in place according to <strong>Goddard Childcare</strong>, a nationwide childcare provider. The Organization released "Operational Blueprint for School Rentry <a href="https://www.oregon.gov/ode/students-and-family/healthsafety/Documents/thegoddardschoolbethany.pdf">saftey guidelines</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Schools with HVAC systems should evaluate the system to minimize indoor air recirculation (thus maximizing fresh outdoor air) to the extent possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider running ventilation systems continuously and changing the filters more frequently. <strong>Do not use fans</strong> if they pose a safety or health risk, such as increasing exposure to pollen/allergies or exacerbating asthma symptoms. Fans should not be used in rooms with closed windows and doors, as this does not allow for fresh air to circulate.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider the need for increased ventilation in areas where students with special health care needs receive medication or treatments</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p>Disable demand-controlled ventilation (DCV) controls that reduce air supply based on occupancy or temperature during occupied hours.</p></li>
<li><p>Use portable high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) fan/filtration systems to help enhance air cleaning, especially in higher risk areas such as common spaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Generate clean-to-less-clean air movement by re-evaluating the positioning of supply and exhaust air diffusers or dampers, especially in higher-risk areas such as common spaces.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider using ultraviolet germicidal irradiationpdf iconexternal icon (UVGI) as a supplement to help inactivate SARS-CoV-2, especially if options for increasing room ventilation are limited.</p></li>

<p>However, the current standards may be improved with accommodation with corridors, elevator shafts, and trash chutes</p>
<ul>
<li>Individual corridor supply fans should be replaced by a central rooftop system that supplies ventilation air to each corridor</li>
<li>Elevator shafts should be equipped with an exhaust flow fan which is controlled by a constant airflow regulator to compensate for seasonal stack-effect variation.</li>
<li>Trash chute should be maintained at a negative pressure</li>

<div id="dilution-ventilation-vs.-displacement-ventilation" class="section level5">
<h5>3.Dilution Ventilation vs. Displacement Ventilation</h5>
<p>Displacement ventilation leads to cleaner air comparing to the mixing ventilation, as contaminants are removed from the occupied zone in a room towards the ceiling, as well as minimizing drafts.</p>
<p>With displacement ventilation, air is introduced at low velocity into a room at a low level and is exhausted at the ceiling. The flow of air is maintained by convective forces, which also have the effect of the concentration of pollutants rising from floor to ceiling.</p>
<p>For now, displacement ventilation is used mostly in Europe, and rarely in residential applications.</p>

<li><p>Minimum air changes of outdoor air per hour is two.</p></li>
<li><p>Air may not be recirculated by means of room units.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than just relying on the building’s HVAC system capacity, use a HEPA air filtration unit to reduce aerosol concentrations in the room and increase the effectiveness of the turnover time.</p>
<p>Place the HEPA unit near the patient’s chair, but not behind the DHCP. Ensure the DHCP are not positioned between the unit and the patient’s mouth. Position the unit to ensure that it does not pull air into or past the breathing zone of the DHCP.</p>
<p>Moreover, considering dental offices have patients with different health histories and they may be more susceptible to infections from bioaerosols, it would be better to avoid aerosol generating procedures</p>
