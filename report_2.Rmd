## Ventilation and Coronavirus (COVID-19)


**An important approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants or contaminants including any viruses that may be in the air is to increase ventilation – the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Ensuring proper ventilation with outside air can help reduce the concentration of airborne contaminants, including viruses, indoors. **

**The ventilation rate should be based on the number of people that occupy an indoor space (and a few other factors), people should give special consideration to increased ventilation when occupancy increases and for areas with high-traffic.**

**Improving ventilation also benefits indoor air quality by reducing exposure to products used for cleaning and disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces.**

**When used along with other best practices recommended by CDC and others, increasing ventilation can be part of a plan to protect people indoors.**
