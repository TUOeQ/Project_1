## Ventilation and Coronavirus (COVID-19)


**An important approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants or contaminants including any viruses that may be in the air is to increase ventilation – the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Ensuring proper ventilation with outside air can help reduce the concentration of airborne contaminants, including viruses, indoors. **

**The ventilation rate should be based on the number of people that occupy an indoor space (and a few other factors), people should give special consideration to increased ventilation when occupancy increases and for areas with high-traffic.**

**Improving ventilation also benefits indoor air quality by reducing exposure to products used for cleaning and disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces.**

**When used along with other best practices recommended by CDC and others, increasing ventilation can be part of a plan to protect people indoors.**



* Elderly Care Facilities, Day Care Centers

* Hotel Rooms

* College Dormitories, School Classrooms

* Multifamily Housing

* Doctor Office, Dentist Clinic

* Hospital Rooms

## *What is ASHRAE?*

[ASHRAE](https://www.ashrae.org/) stands for the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, which is the technical body that develops and maintains ventilation standards for the United States. Ventilation codes and energy efficiency programs throughout the U.S. are based on ASHRAE standards.

Since most of our discussion would be based on the ASHRAE standards, here is a brief overview of the most popular subsegment principles in ASHRAE.

<br>

### What is ASHRAE Standard 62.2?

Formed in 1996, the ASHRAE 62.2 committee developed and maintains a residential ventilation standard for buildings three stories and less which is titled Ventilation and Acceptable Indoor Air Quality in Low-Rise Residential Buildings. It is reviewed and revised every three years. The first version of Standard 62.2 was published in 2003, the second in 2007, and the most current version is ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 62.2-2010. (ANSI stands for the American National Standards Institute. ANSI certification of a standard means that a specific consensus process was used to develop and maintain the standard and is required for adoption of a standard into codes.)

ASHRAE Standard 62.2 is the ventilation standard that applies to low-rise residential buildings of three stories or less in the U.S. ASHRAE Standard 62.1 applies to all other buildings.

### What is ASHRAE Standard 170?

Developed in partnership with Facility Guidelines Institute (FGI) and American Society of Health Care Engineering (ASHE), ASHRAE Standard-170 has been providing key guidance for ventilation requirements for health care industry facilities since 2008. Use Standard 170-2017 alongside HVAC Design Manual for Hospitals and Clinics for comprehensive design guidance on hospitals, nursing and outpatient facilities.

### When ASHRAE Standard is Not Enough

Is ASHRAE Standard 62.2/170 current best practice for ventilation? 

In a word, no. The standard that national experts could agree upon that sets a minimum standard for ventilation — not best practice, which would further customize ventilation rates based on factors such as number of occupants in a dwelling and strength of pollutant sources.

Meeting the ventilation requirements for ASHRAE Standard 62.2 will not always provide enough ventilation for a home. In these circumstances, ventilation rates need to be increased beyond the Standard.

* The Standard does not address high-polluting events such as painting, cleaning, smoking, or construction projects.
* The Standard does not address the use of unvented combustion space heaters such as unvented decorative gas appliances and kerosene heaters, which are not allowed in California.
* The Standard assumes one person per bedroom, with two people in the master bedroom. Higher numbers of occupants will increase ventilation needs.
* Occupants with health issues such as asthma and allergies may benefit from increased ventilation and/or filtration.

### Residential Energy Code

```{r}
colorize <- function(x, color) {
  if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
    sprintf("\\textcolor{%s}{%s}", color, x)
  } else if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
    sprintf("<span style='color: %s;'>%s</span>", color, 
      x)
  } else x
}
```
