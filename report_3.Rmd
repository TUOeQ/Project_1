##### Exhaust Fan & Air Supply 

Panasonic offers basically the same range of products in the bathroom ventilation, comparing with Broan. The only product gap highlights in the entertaining experience.

The bluetooth fans from Broan are featured in entertaining the bathing experience with the [ChromaComfort™ fan](https://www.broan-nutone.com/en-us/chromacomfort) combines colorful LED lighting options and [Broan® Sensonic™](https://www.broan-nutone.com/en-us/sensonic) exhaust vent fan with a build-in speaker.

<br>

##### Range Hoods

Panasonic range hood products are not as diverse as Broan. They are more traditionally designed and focus on the indoor aspect. 

Whereas Broan has advantages in diverse design in the [build-in and island range hood,500-1500 CFM ](https://www.broan-nutone.com/en-us/product/rangehoods/rmip33), it is one of the leading company in building [downdrift range hoods,500 CFM](https://www.broan-nutone.com/en-us/range-hoods/downdraft) which compatible with both island and traditional cooktop.

<br>

<br>


##### Heating Fans

Broan features spot heating as one of their speacialty and it introduced 
[Attic ventilation system](https://www.broan-nutone.com/en-us/specialty-ventilation-heating) to prevent heat and moisture build-up, which could extend roof life by preventing rot, premature aging and shingle distortion.

Worth noting that Panasonic has ventilaition fan with similar function. Although [WhisperValue® DC™ Fan, Condensation Sensor](https://na.panasonic.com/us/home-and-building-solutions/ventilation-indoor-air-quality/ventilation-fans/whispervaluer-dctm-fan-condensation-sensor) was advertised for bathroom, it could be a potential multi-purpose solution.

<br>


#### HEPA filters

Panasonic’s global HEPA filter has obvious advantages over Broan's listed catalog. Broan provided two series of  [whole-house solution ventilation fans](https://www.broan-nutone.com/en-us/search?q=HEPA) with CFM rate range in 100-250 CFM. 

* [Advanced Series Energy Recovery Ventilator](https://www.broan-nutone.com/en-us/product/freshairsystems/ervh100s), 100-104 CFM
* [HE Series High Efficiency Heat Recovery Ventilator](https://www.broan-nutone.com/en-us/product/freshairsystems/hrv200te), 210-250 CFM

However, for Panasonic North America, the choice of[ high-efficiency ventilator](https://na.panasonic.com/us/home-and-building-solutions/ventilation-indoor-air-quality/energy-recovery-ventilators/intelli-balancetm-100-balanced-air-50-100cfm) is limited and with a relatively low CFM rate at 50 to 100.

#### Special Designed tools for customer

Another interesting finding for the Broan is that they have provided some inspiring tools for customers to try out and learn more about their needs for ventilation.
