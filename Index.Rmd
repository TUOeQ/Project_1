## Research new market & sales opportunities (like healthcare, nursing homes, dentist office, etc)

<br>

**As the World is identifying the Health risks associated with viruses like COVID, there is a big opportunity to bring existing Panasonic products to the North America Market.  The NanoX and Ziano technologies have substantial market opportunities in the following markets - Elderly Care Facilities, Doctors Offices, Dentist Offices, Individual Hospital Rooms, College Dormatories, School Classrooms, etc.  These are areas outside our current range of expertise and we need to gather a lot of information to assess the market opportunities.**  

**The Goal of the project will be to establish sales opportunities in these areas and understand the willingness to pay for the technologies.**

## Motivations


  According to [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/coronavirus/ventilation-and-coronavirus-covid-19), an important approach to lowering the concentrations of indoor air pollutants or contaminants including any viruses that may be in the air is to increase ventilation â€“ the amount of outdoor air coming indoors. Ensuring proper ventilation with outside air can help reduce the concentration of airborne contaminants, including viruses, indoors. 

The ventilation rate should be based on the number of people that occupy an indoor space (and a few other factors), people should give special consideration to increased ventilation when occupancy increases and for areas with high-traffic. Improving ventilation also benefits indoor air quality by reducing exposure to products used for cleaning and disinfecting potentially contaminated surfaces.

When used along with other best practices recommended by CDC and others, increasing ventilation can be part of a plan to protect people indoors.
