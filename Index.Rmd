## Research new market & sales opportunities (like healthcare, nursing homes, dentist office, etc)

<br>

**As the World is identifying the Health risks associated with viruses like COVID, there is a big opportunity to bring existing Panasonic products to the North America Market.  The NanoX and Ziano technologies have substantial market opportunities in the following markets - Elderly Care Facilities, Doctors Offices, Dentist Offices, Individual Hospital Rooms, College Dormatories, School Classrooms, etc.  These are areas outside our current range of expertise and we need to gather a lot of information to assess the market opportunities.**  

**The Goal of the project will be to establish sales opportunities in these areas and understand the willingness to pay for the technologies.**
