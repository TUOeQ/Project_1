## Motivation

<br>

Under the scenrio of global pandemic...

<br>

## Initial Research for Potential Markets

<br>

* Individual Hospital Rooms

* Doctors Office, Dentist Office

* College Dormitories, School Classrooms

* Elderly Care Facilities,Day care centers

<br>

### Hospital Rooms

<br> 
US hospital system has four major divsions and includes following

* U.S. Community hospital —— 84.60%


* Federal Government Hospitals —— 3.40%


* Nonfederal Psychiatric Hospitals —— 10.00%


* Other Hospitals for nonfederal long term care hospitals and hospital units within an institution such as a prison hospital or school infirmary —— 2.00%

There are of total 6,146 US hospital from the AHA hospital statistic published 2018 statistics, where staffed beds could count up to 924,107. 

Comapring to the total of 5,534 US hospital in 2016, the CAGR accounts for 5.376%

#### Opportunity



#### 1. Airborne Infections Isolation (AII) Room

AII room, also known as Negative pressure ward, has a [restrctive setting](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/webcourses/course/chapter7/7_infection_control_7_infection_control_program_airborne_infection_isolation_aii_room.html) guide by CDC. 

A special high efficiency air (HEPA) filter that removes most (99.97%) of the droplet nuclei before it is returned to the general circulation has to be implemented.
<br>

#### 2. The Increment for Single Patient Rooms 

["The Use of Single Patient Rooms versus Multiple Occupancy Rooms
in Acute Care Environments"](https://www.healthdesign.org/sites/default/files/use_of_single_patient_rooms_v_multiple_occ._rooms-acute_care.pdf)strongly suggested that it is critical that infected patients or patients highly susceptible to infections need to be isolated in private rooms with proper ventilation. 

What's more, preliminary findings at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Michigan demonstrate that private rooms, with well-design air-flow have resulted in a 10 to 11 percent decline in overall nosocomial infections rates

### Doctors Office, Dentist Office

<br>



#### Dentist Office

The guidelines from [US Oral Health Workforce Projections, 2017-2030](https://bhw.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bhw/health-workforce-analysis/research/projections/oral-health-2017-2030.pdf)
showed that the national demand for dentists is projected to increase by 9 percent to
206,850 FTEs in 2030. Roughly similar growth rates are also predicted in the demand for general dentists (9
percent), oral surgeons (7 percent), endodontists (7 percent), periodontists (11 percent) and other dentists
(12 percent), while the demand for pediatric dentists (2 percent) and orthodontists (-1 percent) is expected
to grow slowly or not at all (Exhibit 1).
