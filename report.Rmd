## Motivation

<br>

Under the scenrio of global pandemic...

<br>

## Initial Research for Potential Markets

<br>

* Individual Hospital Rooms

* Doctors Office, Dentist Office

* College Dormitories, School Classrooms

* Elderly Care Facilities,Day care centers

<br>

### Hospital Rooms

<br> 
US hospital system has four major divsions and includes following

* U.S. Community hospital —— 84.60%


* Federal Government Hospitals —— 3.40%


* Nonfederal Psychiatric Hospitals —— 10.00%


* Other Hospitals for nonfederal long term care hospitals and hospital units within an institution such as a prison hospital or school infirmary —— 2.00%

There are of total 6,146 US hospital from the AHA hospital statistic published 2018 statistics, where staffed beds could count up to 924,107. 

Comapring to the total of 5,534 US hospital in 2016, the CAGR accounts for 5.376%

#### Opportunity



#### 1. Airborne Infections Isolation (AII) Room

AII room, also known as Negative pressure ward, has a [restrctive setting](https://www.cdc.gov/tb/webcourses/course/chapter7/7_infection_control_7_infection_control_program_airborne_infection_isolation_aii_room.html) guide by CDC. 

A special high efficiency air (HEPA) filter that removes most (99.97%) of the droplet nuclei before it is returned to the general circulation has to be implemented.
<br>

#### 2. The Increment for Single Patient Rooms 

["The Use of Single Patient Rooms versus Multiple Occupancy Rooms
in Acute Care Environments"](https://www.healthdesign.org/sites/default/files/use_of_single_patient_rooms_v_multiple_occ._rooms-acute_care.pdf)strongly suggested that it is critical that infected patients or patients highly susceptible to infections need to be isolated in private rooms with proper ventilation. 

What's more, preliminary findings at Bronson Methodist Hospital in Michigan demonstrate that private rooms, with well-design air-flow have resulted in a 10 to 11 percent decline in overall nosocomial infections rates

### Doctors Office & E/M Visits, Dentist Office

<br>

#### Doctors Office & Emergency Department Visits

Centers for Disease Control(CDC) has published statistics on the [Office-based Physician Visits, 2016](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db331.htm), The 2016 sample consists of 3,699 physicians. Participating physicians provided 13,165 visit records, with an attrition rate up to 60%.

In 2016, most Americans had a usual place to receive health care (86% of adults and 96% of children). The majority of children and adults listed a doctor’s office as the usual place they received care. Projection has been made that in 2016, there were an estimated 883.7 million office-based physician visits in the United States and there were an estimated 278 office-based physician visits per 100 persons.

As one doctor would treat approximately 4 patients who would visit 3 times annually, the doctor offices in United States would be at least 73,641,666 in 2016.

However, the prediction for doctor offices would also be affect by the numbers of hospital, the budget and growth of full time equivalent for doctors.

#### Dentist Office

The guidelines from [US Oral Health Workforce Projections, 2017-2030](https://bhw.hrsa.gov/sites/default/files/bhw/health-workforce-analysis/research/projections/oral-health-2017-2030.pdf) showed that the national demand for dentists is projected to increase by 9 percent acrossing the industry to 206,850 FTEs in 2030, while the demand for pediatric dentists (2 percent) and orthodontists (-1 percent) is expected to grow slowly or not at all (Exhibit 1).
```{r}
library(plotly)
data1 = read_csv(file = "dentist_2030.txt",col_names = TRUE)

data1%>%
   plot_ly(x = ~type, y = ~percent, color = ~type, colors = "Greens",type = "bar")
```

**In general,projection of the overall dentists'office in 2030 in the US would be 1,344,525.**

Adjusting for the number of offuce in practical, [Current standards](https://blog.hjtdesign.com/how-many-dental-operatories) suggest that five to eight operatories may be the perfect and the number for any office with a single dentist and the working environment should include following features:

* 3 operation room per dentist at least

* 2 full-time hygienists’ operating room

* 1 optional common office managing the flow of traffic
